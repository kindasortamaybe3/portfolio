      We noted that there was a strong pull towards creating content, sharing

      collaborative cloud storage service.

          User Surveys
        </h3>
        <p>
          User Surveys were used to figure out who the target audience would be.
          Users were gathered using personal contacts, social media contacts and
          other means such as slack & discord channels.
        </p>
        <h4>Key Considerations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How is cloud storage being used</li>
          <li>What do they value as the key features?</li>
          <li>Is there room for real-time collaboration?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Importance was placed on finding users that participate in the use of
          cloud storage software, as described in the brief.
        </p>
        <!--NOT SURE HOW TO PLACE THESE... WILL I MAKE A BOX OR AN IMAGE?-->
        <!--below % results to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
        <!--this-->
        <p>27% Use cloud storage for personal use</p>
        <p>Users want more storage to allow users to collaborate freely</p>
        <!--this-->
        <p>72% Use cloud storage for collaboration</p>
        <p>Majority found cost as the biggest turn-off</p>
        <!--this-->
        <p>100% Use cloud storage for file sharing</p>
        <p>
          Available storage and Accessibility to storage is of high importance
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Analysis of the data showed that a critical number of cloud storage
          users were not pleased with their cloud services due to lack of storage
          for space to create and collaborate freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paying for a service just to store data was no longer an attractive
          alternative as they simply stop using them.

      <section class="Competitive Analysis">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          I delved into the exploration of 3 major cloud storage companies:
        </p>
        <div class="project img">
          <img src="/media/images/Drive.png" alt="Google Drive Logo" />
        </div class="project img">
        <p>
          The interface is very clear, but organising files into folders not
          particularly intuitive. The ability of saving files automatically,
          editing documents and live collaboration is really effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, offline capabilities are restricted. Offering such an array of
          applications puts Google Drive in the lead.
        </p>
        <div class="project img">
          <img src="/media/images/Box.png" alt="Box Logo" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Box is the only cloud based organisation app I have not used. I found
          the onboarding less seamless as the other two. Once on the homepage, the
          main features offered were integration with MS Office, Google Drive and
          more, it definitely increased my interest!
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest strength looks to be when Box Business is purchased. It has
          amazing integration and features once you pay more.
        </p>
        <div class="project img">
          <img src="/media/images/Dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox Logo" />
        </div>
        <p>Dropbox</p>
        <p>
          is commonly used for sharing a variety of media files. The interface
          feels clunky and has a lot of excess options that are jumbled to use and
          doing simple tasks overcomplicates things.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the introduction of Dropbox Paper and the ambience of simplicity in
          sharing multimedia, it may just cross over into competing strongly with
          Google Drive. It wins in terms of access to media files.
        </p>
        <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
        <h3>Enter New Cloud Storage Service!</h3>
        <p>
          There is a gap for developing a product/service which appeals to active
          hobbyists, or recreational users. Most platforms focus on instruction,
          learning, keeping data and rare to find one that is a platform for
          sharing recreationally.

        4 -UP sketching was used before exploring more integrated versions. This

      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <p>
        These screens were in need of clarity, such as a button to indicate when
        it was someone’s turn as the box wasn’t an obvious indicator, as well as
        the “pending user screen being somewhat evasive in obvious signals. It
        can be problematic to communicate things which may depend on imagery and
        colour in design, but the clearer it is here, the less it will need to
        depend on such assets later in the design.

    <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
    <p>
      An orange hue was originally the chosen hue but was quite soft for the
      image needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orange represents things like enthusiasm, determination, success,
      encouragement and stimulation Red is a very emotionally intense color.
      It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises
      blood pressure.
    </p>
    <img src="/media/images/colour.png" alt="Colour choices">
    <p>
      Combined with the original undercurrents of orange with the slight
      “coral” colouring, it combines these aspects.

    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
    <p>
      In keeping with the geometric fonts, we began to sketch up some ideas
      for a name for our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple enough to stand out without cluttering a space, dynamic enough to
      change over time, or use elements of the word mark as icons throughout
      the app

    <p>
      “Game Of…” allows space for continuation of the wording while still
      keeping it’s own identity. The ability to abbreviate into “G.O.” sealed
      the deal for the decision.

      Game Of… and the circular iconographic logo is representative of
      movement and motion. The icon is an abstract representation of the
      brand.

      Keeping the logo somewhat monochromatic allows for future use of
      applying a colour to represent what activity you will be playing.

  <h4>With Colour</h4>

  <h2>Typography</h2>
  <p>
    To keep with imagery of flow, consistency and togetherness, we wanted to
    go with a geometric font.
  </p>
  <img src="media/images/Typography.png" alt="Typography image">
  <p>
    Something clear, concise and bold, yet playful and inclusive. A humanist
    font added an extra layer of creativity that we wanted to reserve for the
    user to utilize.

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>
      We refined our typography, icon and wordmark, imagery, iconography, colors
      and funneled them into our Style Guide for Game Of... that acted as the
      bible for outlying the visuals and their weights to the site.

    <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Below is an example of an area in which a user and I discussed design
      changes that could be made to make the usability clearer and more
      concise.

      It was discussed that perhaps tabs would be a better option, and offer
      more clarity of choices of content.

    <p>Which Slider do you prefer:</p>
    <p>White (left) or Colour (right)?</p>

      For the contrast background, do you prefer it block background, or
      faded?

      Do you prefer the lighter slider button on the left, or the darker one
      on the right?

      Through usability tests and discussion, we managed to acknowledge the
      necessary changes. This helped to execute the design in a way, that was
      much more manageable for the user to understand.
