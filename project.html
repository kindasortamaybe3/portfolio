      <h3>The Client Brief</h3>
        <p>
          We noted that there was a strong pull towards creating content, sharing content, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our client wanted to look into the options of creating a sharing, collaborative cloud storage service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon taking a closer look at the clients brief, we soon realised we had to start from the ground up.
        </p>

      <h3>The Client knew what they wanted but...</h3>

      <p>
        Uncertain how to execute

      <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
      <h3>User Surveys</h3>
      <p>
        User Surveys were used to figure out who the target audience would be.
        Users were gathered using personal contacts, social media contacts and other means such as slack & discord channels.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Key Considerations</h4>
        <li><em>How is cloud storage being used</em></li>
        <li><em>What do they value as the key features?</em></li>
        <li><em>Is there room for real-time collaboration?</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Importance was placed on finding users that participate in the use of cloud storage software, as described in the brief.
      </p>
<!--NOT SURE HOW TO PLACE THESE... WILL I MAKE A BOX OR AN IMAGE?-->
      <ul>
        <p>27% Use cloud storage for personal use</p>
        <p>Users want more storage to allow users to collaborate freely</p>
        <p>72% Use cloud storage for collaboration</p>
        <p>Majority found cost as the biggest turn-off</p>
        <p>100% Use cloud storage for file sharing</p>
        <p>Available storage and Accessibility to storage is of high importance</p>
      </ul>
      <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
      <p>Analysis of the data showed that a critical number of cloud storage users were not pleased with their cloud services due to lack of storage for space to create and collaborate freely.</p>
      <p>Paying for a service just to store data was no longer an attractive alternative as they simply stop using them.</p>

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        I delved into the exploration of 3 major cloud storage companies:
      </p>
<!--INSERT GOOGLE DRIVE FILE HERE-->
      <p>
        The interface is very clear, but organising files into folders not particularly intuitive. The ability of saving files automatically, editing documents and live collaboration is really effective.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, <em>offline capabilities are restricted</em>. Offering such an array of applications puts <em>Google Drive</em> in the lead.

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>User Stories & User Flows:</h3>
      <p>
        Narrowing down the hierarchy of tasks was essential for establishing what
        was going to be mandatory for users to store, create, share and
        collaborate with the developing idea, Game Of… User Stories are an
        integral in developing User Flows to visually show the hierarchy of needs
        established in the spreadsheet and figuring out how to get from each area
        at greater ease and less thought processing. Although these user flows
        look extremely complicated, the more we integrate the tasks into an
        effective flow, the smoother the experience will be for the user. Sketched
        out on white boards before being made digital.
      </p>
      <h3>Sketching & Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        Sketching up different examples to see the format of how they offered
        their services, was key in getting the ball rolling to formulate a
        direction for wireframing Game Of… After sketching some wireframes on
        whiteboard, these were mocked into a digital prototype to begin the first
        round of usability testing. 4 -UP sketching was used before exploring more
        integrated versions. This allowed freedom to sketch without too much
        analysis and offered a more freehand flowing approach.
      </p>
      <h3>Low Fidelity Mockups & Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        From the wireframes I built together a series of screens as digital
        low-fidelity mock-ups and instigated the use of prototyping to expand on
        the design. It was important to insure the wireframes could function as
        initially intended and were user friendly enough to prevent user
        abandonment of the service. Usability Testing with Low Fidelity Mock-Ups:
        The aim of the deployed prototype was to test if the design was clear for
        users to navigate with ease. Key takeaways: The above screens were in need
        of clarity, such as a button to indicate when it was someone’s turn as the
        box wasn’t an obvious indicator, as well as the “pending user screen being
        somewhat evasive in obvious signals. It can be problematic to communicate
        things which may depend on imagery and colour in design, but the clearer
        it is here, the less it will need to depend on such assets later in the
        design. Connecting screens and prototyping had issues in certain areas but
        mainly from the user wanting to click more options which was a good
        indicator of interest. It can sometimes be difficult to recall that the
        main task is to test the main objects as described in the User Stories
        phase. The most useful feedback was more buttons and the users explaining
        in detail their understanding of how things work, to ensure I make it
        clearer for the next test.

      <h2>Visual Aesthetics</h2>
      <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
      <p>
        To generate the branding and identify of Game Of… the main aim was to
        ensure the name had clarity that this was not just a collaborative,
        sharing, cloud based platform; but a game. After word associations, mind
        maps and moodboards, the best sounding was the simplest “Game Of”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dots after were representative of the idea that the brand could
        develop into all sorts of games and ideas depending on what the user
        wants. For sake of design iterations, Game Of Bike was chosen. “Game
        Of…” allows space for continuation of the wording while still keeping
        it’s own identity. The ability to abbreviate into “G.O.” sealed the deal
        for the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sketching ideas that would translate well to the audience can be a
        love/hate process. I sketched more and felt a pull towards an iconographic
        image. Final logo iterations: Style Guide: Building out the style guide,
        brought insights as an overall look of Game Of... It offered up a wealth
        of knowledge about the aesthetics, and served as a constant reminder for
        the brands parameters. Game Of… is representative of its and the
        subsequent iconographic logo is representative of the general “look and
        feel” we were after. Circular shapes imply movement and the icon is an
        abstract representation of the brand. Flowing, clear and moving forward.
        Keeping the logo monochromatic allows for future use of colour
        representative of what activity you will be playing a “Game Of…”. The
        ability to be translated into various colours and used as an inset or
        watermark, without the complications of being confused with any other
        branding. Keeping things basic retains clarity but by including a warm
        shade based on orange as the main colour, helped to represent
        enthusiasm,determination, encouragement and stimulation. The choice of
        this colour came quite quickly, and shade selection took a few iterations
        to induce the “pop” and attention grabbing look required. The typography
        for titles was complimentary as the letter “g” was an important factor.
        For titles, Montserrat was dedicated as the font in general matched the
        “Game of… logo text”. For the written text it was important to keep with
        the “loop tail” g to have a general continuation of the icon as well. This
        helps ties in the type with the logo as well as the icon. It is important
        to disclose the use of the logo and what ways it can and cannot be done,
        to ensure the branding remains true to its intended use. Icons were
        selected in a rounded style to keep consistency with the branding. High
        Fidelity Mockups High Fidelity Mockups: After creating the aesthetic
        styling of Game Of…’s branding and guidelines, creating the concepts into
        high fidelity mockups began.

        Preference Testing: During Hi-Fi Mock-Ups there were some things I noted
        that could be worked on for preference testing as I wasn’t completely sure
        on some stuff. I will be sure to use the video editing slider as an
        option. I considered doing 3 of these but I really need to prioritise the
        use of 3 to compare. Sliders during video editing for length of video
        Background for video editing (ie behind brightness, contrast etc) Slider
        during video editing for video imagery (ie brightness, contrast) I
        submitted the tests not realising I left some of the guides in, and next
        time I will simply export those screens instead of screenshots. Lesson
        learned! The first 3 photos had (at the time of writing this) 63% vs 37%.
        The second 3 photo's had 63% vs 37% as well. The final 3 photo's had 58%
        and 43%. At this stage there were 19 respondents the tests were "not
        statistically significant. It may be performing better due to random
        chance alone.", but I know the differences were subtle, and in the final
        one, might be a case of similarity or in future, highlighting the
        differences in design more obviously somehow - perhaps in asking the
        question I could define the differences as well. Great learning in this
        one! I will apply changes for the "touch ups" checkpoint with these
        results, but will especially do so if there are more respondents resulting
        in more statistical differences. User Testing and Iterations Clickable
        Prototype (Round 3) & Finishing Touches: The results were invaluable and
        the general feedback was intrigue. While this was excellent, the main
        issues were to try to avoid scope creep when doing the usability tests.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <p>
        Game Of… is a project I feel connected to. The processes through this
        reassured me that user research and testing is of upmost importance. As a
        means of understanding the user, these tools cannot be underestimated.
        Creating the experiences and designing the structure that cater to the
        needs of the user is developed by these means. This is much more of a
        reliable and customised source of information for the brand, and is much
        more reliable. This method of specialised research ensured the development
        and creation of a product that was user based, user driven and as such,
        designed for the user in mind. Moving forward, the goal maintained it’s
        momentum though interacting with the users and I hope to continue
        developing this product and idea as a means to expand further on this
        application design as I believe there really is a valuable niche project
        market to be tapped into here.
