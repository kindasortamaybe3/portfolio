      <h1>Project Summary</h1>
      <h3>The Need</h3>
      <p>
        <p>
          In the extreme sports world, there is a need to connect, collaborate and
          share experiences. These sports are more than just about taking risks,
          they are heavily impactful on communities and encourage many walks of
          life to take part. With the technology industries having such sway, it’s
          been proven to be difficult to get people active as everyone is busy
          playing games. Whether it’s on a console, their phone or their desktop,
          people are gaming more than ever.
        </p>
      </p>

      <h3>The Possibilities</h3>
      <p>
        This could be live in the moment, or throughout the week where they can
        upload when they can. The game of H.O.R.S.E. had been adapted from
        basketball into extreme sports. If you were skateboarding, it was a game
        of S.K.A.T.E. and in BMX, a game of B.I.K.E. This enourages riders to
        progress together, create connections, grow friendships and have fun.
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        Game Of.. helps bring sports to the user. Developing an app where they can
        play games interactively with their friends is the obvious solution.
        Although technology has taken over, Game Of… uses this as an opportunity
        to create a game digitally, while still requiring the user to commit to
        physical activity.

      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>
        The main challenge with this project was that there was a very open brief.
        There was a lack of direction which Game Of… wanted to go in. Essentially
        this project could have gone any which way and thus a high risk for scope
        creep was a red flag. Despite this, there were some really good ways this
        could go, but building out an entire brand and concept required a lot of
        broad prospects to be narrowed down.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution:</h3>
      <p>
        https://xd.adobe.com/view/da6eff93-7e60-4311-6887-afa3b3c83f85-ac5f/?fullscreen&hints=off
        To make these red flags green, research was the first important step to
        take. Following with User Research, User Flows and User Stories, these
        were proven to be the biggest assets. Of course, this really outlined how
        the users themselves are such useful resources! Using other means such as
        competitive analysis and content strategy, Game Of… started taking shape.
        The idea for Game Of… did change slightly at the point of Wireframes. Due
        to the sketching and developed ideation, the concept evolved and started
        to roll and take shape. Once the first round of Usability Tests were
        completed, the project began to roll naturally. Following onwards from
        complicated Important: keep the main focus in the brief, which was to
        create a “visual based sharing/network platform”.

    <h1>The Process</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
      <h3>User Surveys</h3>
      <p>
        These were used to figure out who the target audience would be. Users were
        gathered using personal contacts, social media contacts and other means
        such as slack & discord channels. Importance was placed on finding users
        that participate in the use of cloud storage software, as described in the
        brief. Key information needed: What features did the user prioritise? What
        were they using this cloud storage for? Did they do this professionally,
        recreationally or both? Did they have more than one cloud storage service,
        if so, why? What frustrations are held with their current service How
        could the cloud storage services be improved Findings: 37.3% use cloud
        storage for personal use : This shows a potential market 73.7% use these
        for collaboration : Good indication for the brief Majority found the cost
        as the biggest turn-off to using cloud storage software Available storage
        and Accessibility to the storage is of high importance Other applications
        such as iMessage, Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp were explored as
        alternative sources people use for collaboration (but in a more casual
        sense) and found that 100% of respondents used these for file sharing in
        some manner. These apps would be worth exploring further. Analysis of the
        data showed that a critical number of cloud storage users were not pleased
        with their cloud services due to lack of storage for space to create and
        collaborate freely. Paying for a service just to store data was no longer
        an attractive alternative as they simply stop using them.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        I delved into the exploration of 3 major cloud storage companies: Dropbox
        Google Drive Box With this I looked at the most popular or well known
        cloud services. What was most interesting is that there is a gap for
        developing something which appeals to active hobbyists, or recreational
        users. Most platforms focus on instruction, learning, keeping data and
        rare to find one that is a platform for sharing recreationally.
      </p>
      <!--LLink to file here-->
      <h3>User Personas:</h3>
      <p>
        To expand our understanding of user needs, exploring who our main audience
        were and how we can try to solve their current frustrations, was done
        using user personas. We could endeavor to see how Game Of… could motivate
        users to collaborate and interact with our services. Users had combined
        frustrations across the board although in slightly different forms.
        Knowing their goals was important but addressing pain points was
        paramount.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>User Stories & User Flows:</h3>
      <p>
        Narrowing down the hierarchy of tasks was essential for establishing what
        was going to be mandatory for users to store, create, share and
        collaborate with the developing idea, Game Of… User Stories are an
        integral in developing User Flows to visually show the hierarchy of needs
        established in the spreadsheet and figuring out how to get from each area
        at greater ease and less thought processing. Although these user flows
        look extremely complicated, the more we integrate the tasks into an
        effective flow, the smoother the experience will be for the user. Sketched
        out on white boards before being made digital.
      </p>
      <h3>Sketching & Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        Sketching up different examples to see the format of how they offered
        their services, was key in getting the ball rolling to formulate a
        direction for wireframing Game Of… After sketching some wireframes on
        whiteboard, these were mocked into a digital prototype to begin the first
        round of usability testing. 4 -UP sketching was used before exploring more
        integrated versions. This allowed freedom to sketch without too much
        analysis and offered a more freehand flowing approach.
      </p>
      <h3>Low Fidelity Mockups & Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        From the wireframes I built together a series of screens as digital
        low-fidelity mock-ups and instigated the use of prototyping to expand on
        the design. It was important to insure the wireframes could function as
        initially intended and were user friendly enough to prevent user
        abandonment of the service. Usability Testing with Low Fidelity Mock-Ups:
        The aim of the deployed prototype was to test if the design was clear for
        users to navigate with ease. Key takeaways: The above screens were in need
        of clarity, such as a button to indicate when it was someone’s turn as the
        box wasn’t an obvious indicator, as well as the “pending user screen being
        somewhat evasive in obvious signals. It can be problematic to communicate
        things which may depend on imagery and colour in design, but the clearer
        it is here, the less it will need to depend on such assets later in the
        design. Connecting screens and prototyping had issues in certain areas but
        mainly from the user wanting to click more options which was a good
        indicator of interest. It can sometimes be difficult to recall that the
        main task is to test the main objects as described in the User Stories
        phase. The most useful feedback was more buttons and the users explaining
        in detail their understanding of how things work, to ensure I make it
        clearer for the next test.

      <h2>Visual Aesthetics</h2>
      <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
      <p>
        To generate the branding and identify of Game Of… the main aim was to
        ensure the name had clarity that this was not just a collaborative,
        sharing, cloud based platform; but a game. After word associations, mind
        maps and moodboards, the best sounding was the simplest “Game Of”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dots after were representative of the idea that the brand could
        develop into all sorts of games and ideas depending on what the user
        wants. For sake of design iterations, Game Of Bike was chosen. “Game
        Of…” allows space for continuation of the wording while still keeping
        it’s own identity. The ability to abbreviate into “G.O.” sealed the deal
        for the decision.
      </p>
      Sketching ideas that would translate well to the audience can be a
      love/hate process. I sketched more and felt a pull towards an iconographic
      image. Final logo iterations: Style Guide: Building out the style guide,
      brought insights as an overall look of Game Of... It offered up a wealth
      of knowledge about the aesthetics, and served as a constant reminder for
      the brands parameters. Game Of… is representative of its and the
      subsequent iconographic logo is representative of the general “look and
      feel” we were after. Circular shapes imply movement and the icon is an
      abstract representation of the brand. Flowing, clear and moving forward.
      Keeping the logo monochromatic allows for future use of colour
      representative of what activity you will be playing a “Game Of…”. The
      ability to be translated into various colours and used as an inset or
      watermark, without the complications of being confused with any other
      branding. Keeping things basic retains clarity but by including a warm
      shade based on orange as the main colour, helped to represent
      enthusiasm,determination, encouragement and stimulation. The choice of
      this colour came quite quickly, and shade selection took a few iterations
      to induce the “pop” and attention grabbing look required. The typography
      for titles was complimentary as the letter “g” was an important factor.
      For titles, Montserrat was dedicated as the font in general matched the
      “Game of… logo text”. For the written text it was important to keep with
      the “loop tail” g to have a general continuation of the icon as well. This
      helps ties in the type with the logo as well as the icon. It is important
      to disclose the use of the logo and what ways it can and cannot be done,
      to ensure the branding remains true to its intended use. Icons were
      selected in a rounded style to keep consistency with the branding. High
      Fidelity Mockups High Fidelity Mockups: After creating the aesthetic
      styling of Game Of…’s branding and guidelines, creating the concepts into
      high fidelity mockups began.

    <section>
      Preference Testing: During Hi-Fi Mock-Ups there were some things I noted
      that could be worked on for preference testing as I wasn’t completely sure
      on some stuff. I will be sure to use the video editing slider as an
      option. I considered doing 3 of these but I really need to prioritise the
      use of 3 to compare. Sliders during video editing for length of video
      Background for video editing (ie behind brightness, contrast etc) Slider
      during video editing for video imagery (ie brightness, contrast) I
      submitted the tests not realising I left some of the guides in, and next
      time I will simply export those screens instead of screenshots. Lesson
      learned! The first 3 photos had (at the time of writing this) 63% vs 37%.
      The second 3 photo's had 63% vs 37% as well. The final 3 photo's had 58%
      and 43%. At this stage there were 19 respondents the tests were "not
      statistically significant. It may be performing better due to random
      chance alone.", but I know the differences were subtle, and in the final
      one, might be a case of similarity or in future, highlighting the
      differences in design more obviously somehow - perhaps in asking the
      question I could define the differences as well. Great learning in this
      one! I will apply changes for the "touch ups" checkpoint with these
      results, but will especially do so if there are more respondents resulting
      in more statistical differences. User Testing and Iterations Clickable
      Prototype (Round 3) & Finishing Touches: The results were invaluable and
      the general feedback was intrigue. While this was excellent, the main
      issues were to try to avoid scope creep when doing the usability tests.
      The main changes to consider were as follows: Make sure the onboarding the
      start of the clickables for usability tests after sign-up. Add language as
      a filter. Buttons for video editing to be more accurate to have a bit of
      fun clicking buttons when testing. Video animation would be great to
      explain how the game is played (N/A for the current mock up). Utilise
      “tags” more for the filtering options. “Join a Game” button option. Have
      games as a list with minor details like skill, live or not and common tags
      with more extensive details later (this is searching for content thus i
      deem N/A for the current mock up). Indicate Live Games and if they are
      actually live RIGHT NOW or live this week etc. Authentication screen. Is
      this important right now? (N/A for this current mock up). Indicate
      changing to gallery page more clearly “add your video” showing steps more
      clearly - name of the trick? Change the order = add players, add video,
      content of rules, filters etc. Sign Up. View/Upload Content. Organise
      Content. Viewing and uploading content does not specify creating a game
      although it can. I must simplify this process for clarity. I greyed out
      some of the feedback which was useful, but not applicable at this time.
      Summary of design changes based on chosen design changes: Joining a Game:
      From: To: For these designs there were quite a few iterations to make this
      process more streamlined and clear. Drop down menu option seemed
      applicable and fit the design. Leaderboard: From: To: For these it was
      about updating the square images into the darker and circular based design
      to keep with the branding. Sign In/Sign Up: From: To: The white space for
      text was overbearing on the eyes in contrast with the background so
      keeping to the dark theme it was updated while maintaining borders which
      adhered to contrasts found in the accessibility guidelines. Onboarding

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <p>
        Game Of… is a project I feel connected to. The processes through this
        reassured me that user research and testing is of upmost importance. As a
        means of understanding the user, these tools cannot be underestimated.
        Creating the experiences and designing the structure that cater to the
        needs of the user is developed by these means. This is much more of a
        reliable and customised source of information for the brand, and is much
        more reliable. This method of specialised research ensured the development
        and creation of a product that was user based, user driven and as such,
        designed for the user in mind. Moving forward, the goal maintained it’s
        momentum though interacting with the users and I hope to continue
        developing this product and idea as a means to expand further on this
        application design as I believe there really is a valuable niche project
        market to be tapped into here.
