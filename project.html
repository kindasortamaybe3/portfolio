    <h2>
      The Client Brief
    </h2>
    <p>
      We noted that there was a strong pull towards creating content, sharing
      content, and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our client wanted to look into the options of creating a sharing,
      collaborative cloud storage service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon taking a closer look at the clients brief, we soon realised we had to
      start from the ground up.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Client knew what they wanted but...

      <h2>
        Discovery Phase
      </h2>
      <h3>
        User Surveys
      </h3>
      <p>
        User Surveys were used to figure out who the target audience would be.
        Users were gathered using personal contacts, social media contacts and
        other means such as slack & discord channels.
      </p>
      <h4>Key Considerations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>How is cloud storage being used</li>
        <li>What do they value as the key features?</li>
        <li>Is there room for real-time collaboration?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Importance was placed on finding users that participate in the use of
        cloud storage software, as described in the brief.
      </p>
      <!--NOT SURE HOW TO PLACE THESE... WILL I MAKE A BOX OR AN IMAGE?-->
      <!--below % results to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <!--this-->
      <p>27% Use cloud storage for personal use</p>
      <p>Users want more storage to allow users to collaborate freely</p>
      <!--this-->
      <p>72% Use cloud storage for collaboration</p>
      <p>Majority found cost as the biggest turn-off</p>
      <!--this-->
      <p>100% Use cloud storage for file sharing</p>
      <p>
        Available storage and Accessibility to storage is of high importance
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
      <p>
        Analysis of the data showed that a critical number of cloud storage
        users were not pleased with their cloud services due to lack of storage
        for space to create and collaborate freely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paying for a service just to store data was no longer an attractive
        alternative as they simply stop using them.

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        I delved into the exploration of 3 major cloud storage companies:
      </p>
      <!--INSERT GOOGLE DRIVE IMAGE FILE HERE-->
      <p>
        The interface is very clear, but organising files into folders not
        particularly intuitive. The ability of saving files automatically,
        editing documents and live collaboration is really effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, offline capabilities are restricted. Offering such an array of
        applications puts Google Drive in the lead.
      </p>
      <!--INSERT BOX IMAGE FILE HERE-->
      <p>
        Box is the only cloud based organisation app I have not used. I found
        the onboarding less seamless as the other two. Once on the homepage, the
        main features offered were integration with MS Office, Google Drive and
        more, it definitely increased my interest!
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest strength looks to be when Box Business is purchased. It has
        amazing integration and features once you pay more.
      </p>
      <!--INSERT DROPBOX IMAGE FILE HERE-->
      <p>Dropbox</p>
      <p>
        is commonly used for sharing a variety of media files. The interface
        feels clunky and has a lot of excess options that are jumbled to use and
        doing simple tasks overcomplicates things.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the introduction of Dropbox Paper and the ambience of simplicity in
        sharing multimedia, it may just cross over into competing strongly with
        Google Drive. It wins in terms of access to media files.
      </p>
      <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <h3>Enter New Cloud Storage Service!</h3>
      <p>
        There is a gap for developing a product/service which appeals to active
        hobbyists, or recreational users. Most platforms focus on instruction,
        learning, keeping data and rare to find one that is a platform for
        sharing recreationally.
      </p>
      <!--Link to file here COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS "View Competitive Analysis"-->
      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>
        Personas help expand our understanding of user needs, exploring who our
        main audience is, and how we can try to solve their current
        frustrations. We could endeavor to see how Game Of… could motivate users
        to collaborate and interact with our services.

        Users had combined frustrations across the board although in slightly
        different forms. Knowing their goals was important but addressing pain
        points was paramount.

      <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <p>
        Narrowing down the hierarchy of tasks was essential for establishing
        what was going to be mandatory for users to store, create, share and
        collaborate with the developing idea, Game Of…
      </p>
      <!--IMAGE FOR USER STORIES AND following... Link to file here USER STORIES "View User Stories"-->
      <h2>User Flows</h2>
      <p>
        User Stories were integral in developing User Flows to visually show the
        hierarchy of needs established in the spreadsheet and figuring out how
        to get from each area at greater ease and less thought processing.
      </p>
      <!--IMAGE FOR USER FLOWS AND following... Link to file here USER FLOWS "View User Flows"-->
      <h2>Wireframes & Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Sketching up different examples to test the format of how services were
        offered, was absolutely key in getting the ball rolling for the project.
        Formulating a direction for wireframing Game Of… was
      </p>
      <!--IMAGE FOR WIREFRAME SKETCHES AND following... Link to file here WIREFRAME SKETCHES "View Wireframe Sketches"-->
      <p>
        4 -UP sketching was used before exploring more integrated versions. This
        allowed freedom to sketch without too much analysis and offered a more
        freehand flowing approach.
      </p>
      <!--IMAGE FOR USER FLOWS AND following... Link to file here USER FLOWS "View User Flows"-->
      <p>
        After sketching some wireframes on whiteboard, a digital prototype was
        created for the first round of usability testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the deployed prototype was to test if the design was clear
        for users to navigate with ease.
      </p>
      <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <p>
        These screens were in need of clarity, such as a button to indicate when
        it was someone’s turn as the box wasn’t an obvious indicator, as well as
        the “pending user screen being somewhat evasive in obvious signals. It
        can be problematic to communicate things which may depend on imagery and
        colour in design, but the clearer it is here, the less it will need to
        depend on such assets later in the design.
      </p>

      <h1>Visual Design</h1>
      <h2>Concept & Identity</h2>
      <!--Station Riders IMAGE HERE-->
      <p>
        Using these values and brand characteristics we created a moodboard to
        see where current popular image searches were coming up based on our key
        values.
      </p>
      <!--MOODBOARD IMAGES HERE-->
      <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        An orange hue was originally the chosen hue but was quite soft for the
        image needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orange represents things like enthusiasm, determination, success,
        encouragement and stimulation Red is a very emotionally intense color.
        It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises
        blood pressure.
      </p>
      <!--COLOUR CHOICE IMAGE HERE-->
      <p>
        Combined with the original undercurrents of orange with the slight
        “coral” colouring, it combines these aspects.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Logo Design</h2>
      <p>
        In keeping with the geometric fonts, we began to sketch up some ideas
        for a name for our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple enough to stand out without cluttering a space, dynamic enough to
        change over time, or use elements of the word mark as icons throughout
        the app
      </p>
      <h4>Hand Sketches</h4>
      <!--IMAGE HERE-->
      <h4>Digital Sketches</h4>
      <!--IMAGE HERE-->
      <p>
        “Game Of…” allows space for continuation of the wording while still
        keeping it’s own identity. The ability to abbreviate into “G.O.” sealed
        the deal for the decision.
      </p>
      <h4>Digital Iteration Font</h4>
      <!--IMAGE HERE-->
      <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <p>
        Game Of… and the circular iconographic logo is representative of
        movement and motion. The icon is an abstract representation of the
        brand.
      </p>
      <h4>Digital Iterations</h4>
      <!--IMAGE HERE-->
      <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <p>
        Keeping the logo somewhat monochromatic allows for future use of
        applying a colour to represent what activity you will be playing.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h4>With Colour</h4>
    <!--IMAGE HERE-->
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
      To keep with imagery of flow, consistency and togetherness, we wanted to
      go with a geometric font.
    </p>
    <!--TYPOGRAPHY IMAGE HERE-->
    <p>
      Something clear, concise and bold, yet playful and inclusive. A humanist
      font added an extra layer of creativity that we wanted to reserve for the
      user to utilize.
    </p>
    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>
      We refined our typography, icon and wordmark, imagery, iconography, colors
      and funneled them into our Style Guide for Game Of... that acted as the
      bible for outlying the visuals and their weights to the site.
    </p>
    <!--STYLE GUIDE IMAGE HERE-->

    <h2>Hi Fidelity Mockups</h2>
    <p>
      After creating the aesthetic styling of Game Of…’s branding and
      guidelines, creating the concepts into high fidelity mockups began.

      <h1>User Testing and Iterations</h1>
      <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Below is an example of an area in which a user and I discussed design
        changes that could be made to make the usability clearer and more
        concise.
      </p>
      <p>Before</p>
      <!--Before IMAGE HERE-->
      <p>After</p>
      <!--After IMAGE HERE-->
      <p>
        It was discussed that perhaps tabs would be a better option, and offer
        more clarity of choices of content.
      </p>
      <p>Which Slider do you prefer:</p>
      <p>White (left) or Colour (right)?</p>
      <!--Video Slider Editing IMAGES HERE-->
      <p>
        For the contrast background, do you prefer it block background, or
        faded?
      </p>
      <!--Video CONTRAST Editing IMAGES HERE-->
      <p>
        Do you prefer the lighter slider button on the left, or the darker one
        on the right?
      </p>
      <!--Video CIRCLE Slider IMAGES HERE-->
      <!--below to be in a PURPLE TEXT BOX-->
      <p>
        Through usability tests and discussion, we managed to acknowledge the
        necessary changes. This helped to execute the design in a way, that was
        much more manageable for the user to understand.
